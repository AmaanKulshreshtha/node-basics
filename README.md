# THE BASICS OF NODEjs

Find the detailed notes in readme.txt

Move all the files into the root directory to run them with the npm command

If all of them are kept simultaneously in the root directory then, make sure you name the files different.


For Ex: There are 3 server.js files.
If you are planning to keep them in the directory at the same time, then name them as server1.js, server2.js and server3.js respectively.

Reapeat the above drill for any other files.
